			FIG. 1. Living wage information by county. Living wage is an estimate for the cost of living in that location. Data is taken from the Living Wage calculator [1] and historical snapshots of the website. Hovering over a county displays the living wage value as well as the poverty wage and the minimum wage for that county. Missing data is indicated by a gray fill.

	<div class="paragraph">
		<p>
			According to the Living Wage calculator [1], the <i>living wage</i> model "is a market-based approach that draws upon geographically specific expenditure data related to a family's likely minimum food, childcare, health insurance, housing, transportation, and other basic necessities (e.g. clothing, personal care items, etc.) costs." This value depends on the number of earners and children, so we assume one adult worker with zero children--as most graduate students fit into this category. The map in Fig. 1 displays wage data for this group by county over nine years. For practically <b>every single county</b>, the minimum wage is well below the living wage and is in fact much closer to the poverty wage. Furthermore, while the living wage has almost doubled in many counties over the nine years of data, the minimum wage has not been increased to match. These are concerning issues but separate from the motivations of this visualization.

	<div class="paragraph">
		<p>
			So now that we know it is expensive to live in the U.S., how well do graduate stipends support their students when compared to the cost of living? In Fig. 2 we provide evidence supporting the claim that, in general, graduate students are not getting paid enough. Each circle in the map above represents a single university. A circle's size corresponds to the stipend amount for that university averaged over all entries. As such, we lose information about the pay of specific programs. A circle's color indicates whether that university is paying more/less than the living wage for the county in which it is located.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<p>
			The trend to notice is that over the years, while stipends have increased, they have not kept up with the cost of living. This can be seen as more universities are being shaded in red--indicating a stipend that is below the living wage for that county.

			For most occupations we can see that salary increases with educational attainment.
			There was a steep decline in salary in 2008, likely corresponding to the Great Recession,
			but usually salary as increased year to year regardless of educational attainment. It is important to note from
			this data that occupation is more rlevant for predicting salary than education as there is a larger difference
			between occupation classes and educational attainments.

			FIG. 4. Estimated total earnings for a hypothetical individual graduating with a Bachelor's in 2004 and retiring in
			2044. We make the following assumptions: an individual will recive the annual mean stipend value while they are in graduate school,
			a Master's or Professional degree is aquired in 2 years and a Doctorate in 6 years, once out of graduate school an indvidual will
			will be paid the annual mean salary for their educaitonal attinment and occupation, for years 2022-2044 the change in
			pay is equal to the mean change in pay for the previous 17 years. [2][3]

	<div class="paragraph">
		<p>
			We can see that over a person's entire career, further education often results in greater total earnings. However,
			it often takes many years to see this benefit due to significant pay reducation between an industrial salary and
			graduate stipends. It is also worth noting that, for many occupations, a Master's or Professional degree 
			yields greater total career earnings than a Doctorate. 
			This is at least partly due to the much lower increase in salary per year spent in
			graduate school. This serves a disincentive for graduate students to finish a Doctorate. Higher stipends would
			allow for better graduate student retention.
